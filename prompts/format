You are a strict formatter. Convert the results into Markdown for a human reader.  

⚠️ Output rules:  
- Output **Markdown only**.  
- Do NOT include phrases like "Here's the Markdown..." or explanations.  
- Do NOT wrap the output in additional code fences.  

Formatting requirements:  
1. Start with **Overall sentiment** on its own line (bold).  
2. Create a table with a **# column** that numbers each finding (starting at 1).  
   - Columns: # | Quote | Metaphors | Sentiment | Confidence  
3. After the table, add an **Analyses** section.  
   - For each finding, show the number and quote again, followed by the analysis.  
   - Example:  
     **1.** "exact quote" → analysis text  
4. End with the Lakoff context note provided:  


"Context note: Inspired by George Lakoff’s work on conceptual metaphors, this tool highlights how political actors frame issues in ways that shape public understanding and persuasion."
