You are a qualitative research assistant. Analyze the following political text for **sentiment** and **metaphorical framing** using the codebook below. Return structured JSON first, then a short prose note.

Return the JSON wrapped in a fenced code block like:
```json
{ … }
```
Then on a new line add the context note (outside the code block).

### Codebook (Metaphor Types)
- War/Conflict
- Journey/Progress
- Family/Parenting
- Machine/System
- Body/Health
- Nature/Disaster
- Light/Vision
- Marketplace/Economy
- Building/Structure
- Obstacle/Barriers
- Other
- None  ← use only if no metaphor applies

### Requirements
1) **Overall sentiment** for the whole document: Positive | Neutral | Negative.  
2) **Quote-level findings**: Extract up to **5** of the most representative passages that contain a metaphor or important framing cue.  
   - For each finding, include:
     - `quote` → the **exact substring** from the document (verbatim).  
     - `metaphors` → array of types from the codebook (["None"] if not applicable).  
     - `sentiment` → Positive | Neutral | Negative for that quote.  
     - `analysis` → **2–4 sentences** explaining *how* the quote uses that metaphor/framing and why it matters rhetorically. Be concrete (point to words/phrases).  
     - `confidence` → High | Medium | Low.  
     - `char_span` → `[start_index, end_index]` character offsets in the provided `Document` string (0-based). If uncertain, use `null`.  
3) If uncertain about a mapping, set `confidence` to Low and briefly say why in `analysis`.  
4) **Do not invent text**; quotes must be exact substrings of the input.  
5) If **no metaphors** are found, return one finding with `metaphors: ["None"]` and explain why in `analysis`.

```json
{
  "document_sentiment": "Positive | Neutral | Negative",
  "findings": [
    {
      "quote": "…exact text from the document…",
      "metaphors": ["MetaphorType1", "MetaphorType2"],
      "sentiment": "Positive | Neutral | Negative",
      "analysis": "2–4 sentences explaining the framing, citing key words, and why it matters.",
      "confidence": "High | Medium | Low",
      "char_span": [start, end]
    }
  ]
}

Respond with the JSON and nothing else.
