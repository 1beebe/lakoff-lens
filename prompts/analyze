You are a qualitative research assistant. Analyze the following political text for **sentiment** and **metaphorical framing** using the codebook below. Return structured JSON first, then a short prose note.

Return the JSON wrapped in a fenced code block like:
```json
{ … }
```
Then on a new line add the context note (outside the code block).

### Codebook (Metaphor Types)
- War/Conflict
- Journey/Progress
- Family/Parenting
- Machine/System
- Body/Health
- Nature/Disaster
- Light/Vision
- Marketplace/Economy
- Building/Structure
- Obstacle/Barriers
- Other
- None  ← use only if no metaphor applies

### Requirements
1) **Overall sentiment** for the whole document: Positive | Neutral | Negative.  
2)Quote-level findings: Identify all distinct passages that contain a metaphor or clear rhetorical framing cue (not just the five strongest).

Aim to capture every unique metaphor type represented in the text, even if some overlap.

For longer documents, you may summarize repetitive instances using representative examples.

For each finding, include:

quote → exact substring from the document (verbatim).

metaphors → array of all types from the codebook that apply (["None"] if not applicable).

sentiment → Positive | Neutral | Negative for that quote.

analysis → 2–4 sentences explaining how the quote uses each metaphor/framing and why it matters rhetorically. Be concrete (point to words/phrases).

confidence → High | Medium | Low.

char_span → [start_index, end_index] character offsets in the provided Document string (0-based). If uncertain, use null.
3) If uncertain about a mapping, set `confidence` to Low and briefly say why in `analysis`.  
4) **Do not invent text**; quotes must be exact substrings of the input.  
5) If **no metaphors** are found, return one finding with `metaphors: ["None"]` and explain why in `analysis`.

```json
{
  "document_sentiment": "Positive | Neutral | Negative",
  "findings": [
    {
      "quote": "…exact text from the document…",
      "metaphors": ["MetaphorType1", "MetaphorType2"],
      "sentiment": "Positive | Neutral | Negative",
      "analysis": "2–4 sentences explaining the framing, citing key words, and why it matters.",
      "confidence": "High | Medium | Low",
      "char_span": [start, end]
    }
  ]
}

Respond with the JSON and nothing else.
